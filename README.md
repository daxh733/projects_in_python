# 🐍 Python Projects

Welcome to my Python Projects repository!  
This repo is a personal collection of fun and interesting Python-based projects that explore logic, animation, games, and more. Each project is self-contained with simple code and no external dependencies unless specified.

## 🗂️ Projects

| Project Name     | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| 🖼️ Bitmap         | Draws ASCII art from bitmap patterns. A great exercise in string manipulation and control structures. |
| 🃏 Blackjack       | A terminal-based Blackjack card game where you play against the computer. |
| 💿 DVD Animation  | Simulates a bouncing DVD logo in the terminal — just like the nostalgic screensavers! |
| 🎲 Bagels         | A number-guessing logic game where you deduce a secret number using clues like “Fermi”, “Pico”, and “Bagels”. |
